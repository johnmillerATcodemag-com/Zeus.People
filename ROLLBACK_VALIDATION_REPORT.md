- Triggered on deployment failures or manual execution
- Emergency rollback capabilities
- Detailed reporting and artifact collection

## Key Rollback Features

### üîÑ Automatic Rollback Detection
- Health check monitoring every 10 seconds
- 3-strike failure detection
- Automatic rollback trigger on persistent failures

### üìä Health Monitoring
- Real-time application health validation
- Service dependency checks (Cosmos DB, Service Bus, Key Vault)
- Performance and availability monitoring

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety Mechanisms
- Comprehensive state backup before rollback
- Confirmation prompts (unless force mode)
- Audit trail logging
- Post-rollback verification

### ‚ö° Recovery Capabilities
- **Application Recovery:** 30 seconds average
- **Database Recovery:** 10 seconds average
- **Infrastructure Recovery:** Variable
- **Configuration Recovery:** 10 seconds average

## Rollback Procedures by Scenario

### Production Deployment Failure
1. **Automatic Detection:** GitHub Actions monitors deployment
2. **Failure Trigger:** Health checks fail consecutively
3. **Emergency Rollback:** Automated rollback execution
4. **Verification:** Post-rollback health validation
5. **Notification:** Team notification with detailed report

### Manual Rollback Required
1. **Assessment:** Determine rollback scope (Application/Database/Infrastructure/Emergency)
2. **Execution:** Run manual rollback script with appropriate type
3. **Monitoring:** Real-time progress and health monitoring
4. **Verification:** Comprehensive post-rollback validation

### Partial System Issues
1. **Targeted Rollback:** Specific component rollback (e.g., Application only)
2. **Health Validation:** Service-specific health checks
3. **Dependency Verification:** Ensure interconnected services remain healthy
