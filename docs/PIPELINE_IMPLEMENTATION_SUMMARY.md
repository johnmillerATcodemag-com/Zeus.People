## ðŸ“‹ Pipeline Workflow Overview

### Staging Environment Flow

```
Code Push â†’ Build â†’ Test â†’ Security Scan â†’ Package â†’ Deploy to Staging â†’ E2E Tests â†’ Monitoring Setup
```

### Production Environment Flow

```
Staging Success â†’ Manual Approval â†’ Blue-Green Deploy â†’ Health Check â†’ Performance Validation â†’ Monitoring
```

### Emergency Procedures

```
Issue Detected â†’ Emergency Rollback â†’ Validation â†’ Incident Tracking â†’ Post-Rollback Monitoring
```

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps for Implementation

### 1. Azure Setup

```bash
# Create service principal for CI/CD
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "zeus-people-cicd" --role "Contributor" --scopes "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}" --sdk-auth

# Set up resource groups
az group create --name "rg-zeus-people-staging" --location "eastus2"
az group create --name "rg-zeus-people-prod" --location "eastus2"
```

### 2. GitHub Repository Configuration

```bash
# Add required secrets to GitHub repository
AZURE_CLIENT_ID
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
AZURE_TENANT_ID
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
ALERT_EMAIL
TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL
```

### 3. Initial Deployment

```bash
# Update AZD to latest version
winget upgrade Microsoft.Azd

# Initialize and deploy
azd env new zeus-people-staging
azd provision
azd deploy
```

### 4. Monitoring Setup

- Configure Application Insights workspace
- Set up alert rules and action groups
- Configure availability tests
- Set up dashboards for monitoring

### 5. Testing Configuration

- Update test connection strings
- Configure Cosmos DB emulator for integration tests
- Set up performance testing baselines
- Configure security scanning tools
