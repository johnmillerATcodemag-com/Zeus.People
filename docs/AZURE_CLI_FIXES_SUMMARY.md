# Azure Developer CLI GitHub Actions Fixes Summary

## Problem Resolved

Fixed the "getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND azure-dev.azureedge.net" network connectivity error that was preventing GitHub Actions workflows from executing properly.

## Root Cause

The Azure/setup-azd action was attempting to download Azure Developer CLI from azure-dev.azureedge.net CDN which was experiencing DNS resolution failures in GitHub's hosted runners.

## Solution Implemented

Replaced all Azure/setup-azd actions with direct installation methods:

### For Windows Runners (PowerShell)

- Uses `Invoke-RestMethod 'https://aka.ms/install-azd.ps1' | Invoke-Expression`
- Properly handles PATH environment variable refresh
- Includes verification step with `azd version`

### For Linux Runners (Bash)

- Uses `curl -fsSL https://aka.ms/install-azd.sh | bash`
- Adds AZD bin directory to $GITHUB_PATH for subsequent steps
- Includes verification step with `azd version`

## Files Updated

1. **staging-deployment.yml** - Main CI/CD pipeline (Windows PowerShell)
2. **ci-cd-pipeline.yml** - Multiple deployment jobs (Linux bash)
3. **test-staging-deployment.yml** - Staging test workflow (Linux bash)
4. **infrastructure-validation.yml** - Infrastructure validation (Linux bash)
5. **emergency-rollback.yml** - Emergency rollback workflow (Linux bash)

## Key Improvements

- ✅ Eliminates dependency on problematic azure-dev.azureedge.net CDN
- ✅ Uses official Microsoft installation scripts from aka.ms redirects
- ✅ Proper PATH configuration for both Windows and Linux runners
- ✅ Installation verification to catch issues early
- ✅ Conditional installation (only installs if not already present)

## Next Steps for Complete Pipeline Success

### 1. Configure GitHub Repository Secrets

The following secrets need to be configured in GitHub repository settings:

- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` - Service principal application ID
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Service principal password
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID` - Azure tenant ID
- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` - Target Azure subscription ID

### 2. Verify Azure Service Principal Permissions

Ensure the GitHub-Actions-Zeus-People service principal has:

- Contributor role on target subscription
- Access to required Azure resource groups
- Permissions for Azure Developer CLI operations

### 3. Test Workflow Execution

After secrets are configured:

1. Push a small change to trigger workflows
2. Monitor workflow execution in GitHub Actions tab
3. Verify Azure Developer CLI installation step succeeds
4. Confirm subsequent Azure authentication and deployment steps work

## Monitoring Points

- Azure Developer CLI installation time (should be faster than action-based approach)
- PATH configuration success in subsequent steps
- Azure authentication success using installed CLI
- Overall workflow execution time improvements

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Check GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify Azure service principal credentials are correctly configured
3. Ensure installation scripts have proper permissions
4. Check if additional dependencies are required for specific environments

## Testing Status

- ✅ All Azure/setup-azd actions removed from workflows
- ✅ Direct installation scripts implemented with proper error handling
- ✅ PATH configuration added for all environments
- ✅ Verification steps included
- ⏳ **Pending**: Repository secrets configuration
- ⏳ **Pending**: End-to-end workflow testing

## Performance Benefits

- Faster installation (direct download vs action overhead)
- More reliable (eliminates CDN dependency)
- Better error reporting (custom installation logic)
- Consistent across all workflows
