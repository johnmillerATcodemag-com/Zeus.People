      environment:
        description: "Target environment"
        required: true
        default: "staging"
        type: choice
        options:
          - staging
          - dev
      skip_infrastructure:
        description: "Skip infrastructure deployment"
        required: false
        default: false
        type: boolean
      skip_tests:
        description: "Skip validation tests"
        required: false
        default: false
        type: boolean
      cleanup_after_test:
        description: "Clean up resources after testing"
        required: false
        default: false
        type: boolean
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 2 * * *" # Daily at 2 AM UTC
```

#### 2. Local PowerShell Testing

```powershell
# Comprehensive staging deployment test
.\test-staging-deployment.ps1 -EnvironmentName "staging" -Location "eastus2"

# Quick validation test
.\quick-staging-test.ps1 -BaseUrl "https://your-app.azurewebsites.net" -ShowDetails
```

#### 3. Azure Developer CLI Integration

```bash
# Initialize environment
azd init --environment zeus-people-staging

# Provision infrastructure
azd provision

# Deploy application
azd deploy

# Run validation tests
.\test-staging-deployment.ps1 -SkipInfrastructure
```
