## Business Rules Implemented

### Academic Business Rules

- ✅ Employee numbers must be unique
- ✅ Employee names must be unique within department
- ✅ Only valid ranks (P, SL, L) are allowed
- ✅ Tenured academics cannot have contract end dates
- ✅ Only one room per academic
- ✅ Only one extension per academic
- ✅ Only professors can hold chairs
- ✅ Contract end dates must be in the future

### Department Business Rules

- ✅ Department names must be unique
- ✅ Professor who heads department must work for that department
- ✅ Budgets must be positive values
- ✅ Only professors can be department heads

### Room and Extension Business Rules

- ✅ Rooms can only be occupied by one academic
- ✅ Extensions can only be used by one academic
- ✅ Access levels are validated (LOC, INT, NAT)

## Design Decisions and Limitations

### Limitations Due to Domain Model

1. **Academic Updates**: The domain model doesn't have a general `UpdateDetails` method, so updates are limited to available domain methods.
2. **Department Name Updates**: The domain doesn't have an `UpdateName` method.
3. **Tenure Removal**: The domain only supports making academics tenured, not removing tenure.
4. **Contract End Date Clearing**: The domain doesn't support clearing contract end dates.
5. **Department Head Assignment**: Requires a home phone number, which creates a design issue for the command that doesn't include it.

### Design Decisions

1. **CQRS Separation**: Clear separation between command and query sides with different repository interfaces.
2. **Result Pattern**: Used throughout for error handling instead of exceptions in application layer.
3. **Validation Pipeline**: FluentValidation integrated with MediatR pipeline.
4. **Pagination**: Implemented for all list queries to handle large datasets.
5. **Filtering**: Added filtering capabilities to query operations.
6. **Business Rule Enforcement**: Business rules are enforced in command handlers and validated through domain methods.

## Testing

- ✅ Basic unit tests for commands, validators, and DTOs
- ⚠️ Test project has package source mapping issues that need resolution
- 🔄 Integration tests would need repository implementations

## Next Steps

1. Implement Infrastructure layer with repository implementations
2. Resolve test project package issues
3. Add comprehensive integration tests
4. Implement missing domain methods for complete update operations
5. Add AutoMapper profiles for DTO mapping
6. Implement domain event handlers for read model updates
