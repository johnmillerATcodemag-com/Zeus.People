# 🚀 Azure Credentials Configuration - Complete Guide

## ✅ Status: Ready for GitHub Secrets Configuration

Your Azure Service Principal has been created and tested successfully!

## 📋 Required GitHub Secrets (Ready to Add)

### Core Azure Authentication Secrets
- **AZURE_CREDENTIALS**: Service principal JSON (complete configuration)
- **AZURE_CLIENT_ID**: `a90252fe-4d36-4e18-8a85-7e8ecbf04ed0`
- **AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET**: `[REDACTED - Use value from service principal creation]`
- **AZURE_TENANT_ID**: `24db396b-b795-45c9-bcfa-d3559193f2f7`

### Application-Specific Secrets (Use Placeholders Initially)
- **MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID**: `PLACEHOLDER_UPDATE_AFTER_INFRASTRUCTURE_DEPLOYMENT`
- **APP_INSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING**: `PLACEHOLDER_UPDATE_AFTER_INFRASTRUCTURE_DEPLOYMENT`

## 🎯 Quick Setup Steps

### Step 1: Add GitHub Secrets
1. Go to: https://github.com/johnmillerATcodemag-com/Zeus.People/settings/secrets/actions
2. Add all 6 secrets using the values from `GITHUB_SECRETS_CONFIGURATION.md`
3. Use placeholder values for the last 2 secrets initially

### Step 2: Run the Pipeline
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Click on "🚀 Staging Deployment Pipeline"
3. Click **Run workflow** → **Run workflow**
4. Monitor the progress

### Step 3: Update Remaining Secrets (After Infrastructure Deployment)
Once the infrastructure deployment succeeds, run:
```bash
# Get Managed Identity Client ID
az identity show --resource-group rg-academic-staging-westus2 --name managed-identity-academic-staging-2ymnmfmrvsb3w --query clientId --output tsv

# Get Application Insights Connection String
az monitor app-insights component show --app app-insights-academic-staging-2ymnmfmrvsb3w --resource-group rg-academic-staging-westus2 --query connectionString --output tsv
```

Then update the GitHub secrets with the actual values.

## 🔧 Helper Scripts Created

- **`setup-github-secrets.ps1`**: Interactive guide for adding secrets
- **`test-azure-credentials.ps1`**: Verify service principal works
- **`collect-azure-credentials.ps1`**: Comprehensive credential collection
- **`AZURE_CREDENTIALS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`**: Detailed documentation
- **`GITHUB_SECRETS_CONFIGURATION.md`**: Ready-to-copy secret values

## 🎉 What to Expect

After adding the GitHub secrets and running the pipeline:

1. ✅ **Build & Test**: Should complete successfully (already working)
2. ✅ **Security Scan**: Should complete successfully (already working)  
3. ✅ **Infrastructure Deployment**: Should now work with proper credentials
4. ✅ **Application Deployment**: Should deploy your .NET app to Azure App Service
5. ✅ **Staging Tests**: Should run end-to-end tests against deployed app
6. ✅ **Monitoring Setup**: Should configure Application Insights and alerts

## 🔍 Monitoring the Pipeline

Watch for these stages in your GitHub Actions:
- 🔨 Build & Test ✅ (Working)
- 🔒 Security Scan ✅ (Working)
- 🏗️ Deploy Infrastructure ⏳ (Should now work)
- 🚀 Deploy Application ⏳ (Should now work)
- 🧪 Staging Environment Tests ⏳ (Should now work)
- 📊 Setup Monitoring ⏳ (Should now work)

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your pipeline will be fully successful when:
1. All build stages complete without errors
2. Azure infrastructure is created (App Service, Cosmos DB, Key Vault, etc.)
3. Application is deployed and accessible
4. Health checks pass
5. Monitoring is configured

## 🚨 If You Need Help

- Check the pipeline logs in GitHub Actions
- Run `test-azure-credentials.ps1` to verify authentication
- Ensure all secret names and values match exactly
- Verify the service principal has proper permissions

## 🎊 Next Steps After Success

Once your pipeline completes successfully:
1. Your staging environment will be fully operational
2. You can access your app at the Azure App Service URL
3. Monitoring and logging will be active
4. You can run additional test scenarios
5. You can set up production deployment following the same pattern
