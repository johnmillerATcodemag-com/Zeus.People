# CI/CD Pipeline Creation

Create comprehensive CI/CD pipelines for automated building, testing, and deployment using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.

## Requirements

1. Create build pipeline for continuous integration
2. Implement automated testing (unit, integration, E2E)
3. Add code quality gates and security scanning
4. Create deployment pipeline for multiple environments
5. Implement database migration automation
6. Add monitoring and alerting for deployments
7. Configure blue-green deployment strategy
8. Add rollback procedures and disaster recovery

## Pipeline Stages

- Build and compile all projects
- Run unit tests with coverage reporting
- Run integration tests with test databases
- Perform security and dependency scanning
- Build and push container images (if applicable)
- Deploy to staging environment
- Run E2E tests against staging
- Deploy to production with blue-green strategy

## Infrastructure as Code

- Deploy Bicep templates as part of pipeline
- Update Key Vault secrets securely
- Run database migrations automatically
- Configure monitoring and alerting

## Testing Instructions

- Trigger pipeline with code commit
- Verify all build stages complete successfully
- Confirm tests run and pass in pipeline
- Test deployment to staging environment
- Validate E2E tests pass against deployed application
- Test rollback procedures work correctly
- Monitor deployment metrics and logs
