# Comprehensive Testing Implementation

Implement comprehensive testing suite following `.github/instructions/testing-strategy.md` including unit, integration, and E2E tests.

## Requirements

1. Create complete unit test coverage for domain logic
2. Implement integration tests for all handlers
3. Add E2E tests for critical business scenarios
4. Create performance and load tests
5. Implement test data management
6. Add contract testing for APIs
7. Create automated test reporting
8. Implement test environment management

## Test Categories

- Unit Tests: Domain entities, value objects, business rules
- Integration Tests: Command/query handlers, repositories
- E2E Tests: Complete workflows via API
- Performance Tests: Load testing with realistic data
- Contract Tests: API endpoint contracts
- Security Tests: Authentication and authorization

## Key Test Scenarios

- Academic lifecycle (create, update, tenure, contract)
- Department management and staff assignments
- Room and extension assignments
- Business rule enforcement
- Error handling and edge cases
- Concurrent operations and data consistency

## Testing Infrastructure

- Test containers for database testing
- In-memory databases for unit tests
- Test data builders and factories
- Mock services for external dependencies
- Load testing tools and scripts

## Testing Instructions

- Run all tests: `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"`
- Execute load tests: Run performance test suite
- Verify test coverage meets requirements (>80%)
- Test all business rules are enforced
- Confirm error scenarios are handled properly
- Validate concurrent operations work correctly
- Generate test reports and coverage analysis
