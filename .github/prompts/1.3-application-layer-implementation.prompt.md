description: Implement the application layer with CQRS commands, queries, and handlers
---

# Application Layer Implementation

Implement the application layer with CQRS commands, queries, and handlers following the architecture in `.github/instructions/cqrs-architecture.md`.

## Requirements

1. Create commands for all write operations (Create, Update, Delete academics, departments, etc.)
2. Create queries for all read operations with specific DTOs
3. Implement command handlers with business rule enforcement
4. Implement query handlers for read models
5. Add FluentValidation for input validation
6. Implement MediatR for command/query dispatching
7. Create DTOs for API responses
8. Add proper error handling and result patterns

## Key Commands to implement

- CreateAcademicCommand, UpdateAcademicCommand, DeleteAcademicCommand
- AssignAcademicToRoomCommand, AssignAcademicToExtensionCommand
- CreateDepartmentCommand, AssignDepartmentHeadCommand
- SetAcademicTenureCommand, SetContractEndCommand

## Key Queries to implement

- GetAcademicQuery, GetAcademicsByDepartmentQuery
- GetDepartmentQuery, GetDepartmentStaffCountQuery
- GetRoomOccupancyQuery, GetExtensionAccessLevelQuery

## Testing Instructions

- Run application unit tests: `dotnet test tests/Zeus.People.Application.Tests/`
- Verify command handlers enforce business rules
- Test query handlers return correct data
- Validate input validation works properly
- Confirm error handling produces appropriate results
