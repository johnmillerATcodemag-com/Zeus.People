# Monitoring and Observability Setup

Implement comprehensive monitoring, logging, and observability for the Academic Management System using Application Insights and Azure Monitor.

## Requirements

1. Configure Application Insights telemetry
2. Implement structured logging with Serilog
3. Add custom metrics for business events
4. Create dashboards for system health
5. Set up alerting for critical issues
6. Implement distributed tracing
7. Add performance monitoring
8. Create runbooks for incident response

## Monitoring Components

- Application Insights for application telemetry
- Log Analytics for centralized logging
- Azure Monitor for infrastructure metrics
- Custom dashboards for business metrics
- Alert rules for SLA violations
- Performance counters for optimization

## Key Metrics to Monitor

- API response times and error rates
- Database performance and connection health
- Service Bus message processing rates
- Business rule violation counts
- User authentication and authorization
- System resource utilization

## Alerting Rules

- High error rate (>5% in 5 minutes)
- Slow response times (>2 seconds 95th percentile)
- Database connection failures
- Service Bus message backlog
- Authentication failures
- Infrastructure resource issues

## Testing Instructions

- Deploy monitoring configuration to Azure
- Generate test traffic to validate telemetry
- Verify custom metrics appear in dashboards
- Test alert rules trigger correctly
- Confirm logs are structured and searchable
- Validate distributed tracing works across services
- Test incident response procedures
