# Infrastructure Layer Implementation

Implement the infrastructure layer including Entity Framework, event store, and message bus integration following `.github/instructions/cqrs-architecture.md`.

## Requirements

1. Create Entity Framework DbContext for write operations
2. Implement repository pattern for aggregate persistence
3. Create event store for domain event persistence
4. Implement Azure Service Bus integration for event publishing
5. Create read model projections for Cosmos DB
6. Add proper database migrations
7. Implement configuration providers and dependency injection
8. Add health checks for all external dependencies

## Key Infrastructure Components

- AcademicContext (EF Core DbContext)
- EventStore implementation with versioning
- ServiceBusEventPublisher for domain events
- CosmosDbReadModelRepository for queries
- DatabaseHealthCheck, ServiceBusHealthCheck

## Database Schema

- Tables for all entities with proper relationships
- Event store table for domain events
- Proper indexes for performance
- Foreign key constraints for referential integrity

## Testing Instructions

- Run infrastructure tests: `dotnet test tests/Zeus.People.Infrastructure.Tests/`
- Verify database migrations work: `dotnet ef database update`
- Test repository implementations with in-memory database
- Confirm event store persistence and retrieval
- Validate Service Bus message publishing
- Check health checks return appropriate status
