# Domain Model Implementation

Implement the complete domain model for the Academic Management System based on the business rules in `business-rules.md`.

## Requirements

1. Create all entity classes (Academic, Department, Room, Extension, etc.)
2. Implement all value objects (EmpNr, EmpName, Rank, etc.)
3. Create domain events for all state changes
4. Implement all business rule validations in the domain layer
5. Create aggregate roots and ensure consistency boundaries
6. Add proper domain exceptions and error handling

## Focus on these key entities and their relationships

- Academic with EmpNr, EmpName, Rank, and contract details
- Department with professors, senior lecturers, and lecturers
- Room assignments and building relationships
- Extension and access level associations
- Chair and committee assignments
- Degree and university relationships

## Testing Instructions

- Run domain unit tests: `dotnet test tests/Zeus.People.Domain.Tests/`
- Verify all business rules are enforced
- Test entity creation with valid and invalid data
- Validate value object constraints
- Confirm domain events are raised correctly
